# DBLP SPARQL Integration

This extension now performs author search and publication lookup using the [DBLP SPARQL endpoint](https://github.com/dblp/kg/wiki).

## Advantages

- **Flexible queries** – SPARQL allows more precise filtering such as by venue or year.
- **Consistent metadata** – Results are pulled from the official knowledge graph so the information stays up‑to‑date.
- **One endpoint** – Author search and publication details can be fetched using the same API.
