# Google Scholar Venue Ranker



**Instantly see CORE conference rankings and SJR journal quartiles directly on Google Scholar profile pages‚Äîessential context for researchers in Computer Science, Electrical Engineering, and related fields.**

This Chrome extension enhances your Google Scholar experience by automatically fetching and displaying [CORE Conference Rankings](http://portal.core.edu.au/conf-ranks/) for conference publications alongside [SCImago Journal Rank (SJR)](https://www.scimagojr.com/) quartiles for journals. It helps you quickly assess the prestige of publication venues without leaving the Scholar page.

### Why?

Google¬†Scholar is great at collecting publications but **terrible at showing the prestige of publication venues**‚Äîa crucial signal in CS and EE. This add‚Äëon pulls the official **CORE¬†2023 (and historical)** conference lists and the **latest SJR journal quartiles**, surfacing each publication‚Äôs tier directly in the interface.

| üìö **Journal insights**   | Adds SJR quartile badges (Q1‚ÄìQ4) next to journal papers using the latest SCImago data set. |
| üßπ **Name cleanup**       | Removes trailing titles like "PhD" or "Dr." before DBLP lookup for better matches. |


## Quick¬†Install

1.  **Download or Clone:**
    *   **Option A (Download ZIP):** Download the latest¬†[release](https://github.com/naveedanwarbhatti/Google-Scholar-Conference-Ranker/releases/download/v1.6.3/Google-Scholar-Conference-Ranker-v1.6.3.zip), or click on the green "Code" button, then "Download ZIP". Extract the ZIP file to a folder on your computer.

        ```bash
        git clone https://github.com/naveedanwarbhatti/Google-Scholar-Conference-Ranker.git
        ```
        The `dist/content.js` file (the compiled JavaScript) is included in the repository.

2.  **Load the Extension in Chrome:**
    *   Open Google Chrome.
    *   Navigate to `chrome://extensions` (or by clicking Menu -> Extensions -> Manage Extensions).
    *   Enable **"Developer mode"** using the toggle switch, usually found in the top-right corner.
    *   Click the **"Load unpacked"** button that appears (usually on the top-left).
    *   Select the **root directory** of the extension (the folder where `manifest.json` is located, e.g., the `Google-Scholar-Conference-Ranker` folder you downloaded/cloned).

3.  **Verify:**
    *   The "Google Scholar Venue Ranker" should now appear in your list of extensions and be enabled.
    *   Navigate to a Google Scholar profile page (e.g., `https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=...`). The extension should automatically run. You should see the progress bar, then the summary panel, and ranks next to papers.




## Limitations & Troubleshooting

* **DBLP coverage** ‚Äì Papers missing from DBLP are not counted in the summary.
* **Short papers** ‚Äì Conference papers under six pages are excluded as short papers.
* **Name mismatches** ‚Äì DBLP may list your papers under a different name, leading to profile mismatches.
* **Tips**
  * Verify your DBLP profile is correct and matches your Scholar name.
  * Report mismatches or missing venues using the "Report Bug" link.
